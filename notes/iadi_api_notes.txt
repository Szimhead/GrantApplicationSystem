- review goes to application, reviewAPI is removed - Weronika

- panel goes to grantcall, panelAPI is removed - Weronika

- cv goes to student, cvAPI is removed. cv is a subresource of student, but it is also just a list of cv_items, so I guess we don't need to create a cv entity/API, and just have a list of cv_items in each student and perform operations on it directly, like "add cv item to cv" or "get all cv items from cv" - Weronika

- data_item goes to grantCall, add crud methods for it - Weronika

- create cvRequirementAPI - Weronika

- answer goes to application, add crud methods for it - Weronika

- documentation and error codes - Tiago

- write/print report

- add atributes to ER - Szymon only! 



----------------------------!!-----------------------------
- add answer or add answers??

- added /name in url of CVRequirement just to have something for now and see that it works

- delete add panel? all grant calls are created with an empty panel, you just need to add reviewers

- added /dataitems in grancall

- added a addReviewer so we can register reviewers in the system that can then be selected by sponsors to be part of a panel in a grant call.

- added add student, discuss where this should be

- should we have getOneApplication in student?
